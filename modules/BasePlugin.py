    If you write a class that extends this class and put it in the `hoster` directory, it's a hoster plugin as far as
    OCHproxy is concerned.
    The name of the class *must* match the file name.
    Please not that OCHproxy totally trusts plugins and doesn't execute them in a sandbox or something like that.
    This means that you should check your plugin for bugs. If you're asking "What's the worst thing that can happen?" -
    well, I guess you could crash OCHproxy (or if you know what you're doing you could try to get the whole system in
    trouble).
    In the futureâ„¢, it might be possible to have multiple instances of your plugin running with different accounts
    so you should correctly use instance attributes instead of class attributes if they should be different across
    instances.
    Your plugin will be reloaded every time the config changes, so take a look at `persist` if you want to persist
    attributes during reloads.

    TODO: Logging?

    Class Attributes:
        - `hostname`:
            The hostname for which the plugin is responsible or a list of hostnames for which the plugin is responsible.
        - `priority`:
            A positive integer number. The smaller it is, the more likely will the plugin be chosen.
            To be more precise: The plugin with the lowest $priority * bytes downloaded$ will be chosen.
            You should use the constants in Hoster.Priority.
        - `config_values`:
            A list of config values your plugin will use. Use a tuple in the format (key, value) to set a default value
            if it is optional. If a non-optional config item is not provided, your plugin will not be instantiated.
