I guess it's kind of both.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nCurrently, this is the best way to install OCHproxy:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the Git repository.\r\n2. Install python2.\r\n3. Use `python2 setup.py` to install dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nUse `python2 ochload.py` to start the server. After the first run, a file named `config.json` is generated.\r\nYou need to add your usernames and passwords there if you want to use a hoster.\r\n\r\n## Supported hosters\r\nLook in the `hoster` directory for a list of supported hosters.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
